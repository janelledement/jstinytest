  // Notes: I made myIncludes into a method on the array (as opposed to my other 
  // array functions) prototype because it is is supposed to have the capacity
  // to be used on both arrays and array-like objects.  
  
  // I define an object as being array-like if it satisfies two criteria:
  // 1. It has numeric keys
  // 2. It has a length property
  // The arguments object is a good example of an array-like object based on
  // these two characteristics.

  //Signature: 
    // array.myIncludes(searchElement[, fromIndex])
     // array
     // searchElement
     // searchIndex (optional)
  //Return:
    // Boolean

        index = length + searchIndex;
      } else {

  //Specs:
    // It should search the array for given element, return true if found and false if not.
    // It should start at optional startIndex if provided.
    // It should return false immediately if searchIndex is greater than or equal to array.length.
    // It should accept negative numbers for searchIndex, offsetting the position for start of search from end of array.
    // It should search the whole array if the calculated offset from negative searchIndex is less than zero.
    // It should be able to be used on array-objects using apply or call function methods
